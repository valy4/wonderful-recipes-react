      <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
      <p>
        Veganuary is a non-profit organisation that encourages people worldwide
        to try vegan for January and beyond. During the 2021 campaign, more than
        500,000 people took our pledge to try a vegan diet, while more than 825
        new vegan products and menu options were launched in our key campaign
        countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the year, Veganuary encourages and supports people and
        businesses alike to move to a plant-based diet as a way of protecting
        the environment, preventing animal suffering, and improving the health
        of millions of people.
      </p>
      <h1>VISION, MISSION AND VALUES</h1>
      <p>
        Our vision is simple; we want a vegan world. A world without animal
        farms and slaughterhouses.
      </p>
      <p> A world where food production does not
      decimate forests, pollute rivers and oceans, exacerbate climate change
      and drive wild animal populations to extinction. Our mission is to
      inspire and support people to try vegan, drive corporate change, and
      create a global mass movement championing compassionate food choices
      with the aim of ending animal farming, protecting the planet, and
        improving human health.</p>
      <h1>OUR VALUES</h1>
      <ul>
        Impact: we are committed to a vegan world; we will utilise research to evaluate how the highest number of lives can be spared and direct resources to that end.

        Empowerment: we will optimise our outreach to support and encourage people on their vegan journey in a non-judgmental, positive, constructive, and easily accessible way.

        Collaboration: by partnering with other mission-driven organisations and working closely with businesses, we will make a bigger difference.

        Diversity and inclusion: we know that it takes people with different ideas, strengths, interests and backgrounds to achieve our vision; we appreciate the value of this and how it brings us closer to achieving our mission.

        Respect and integrity: in all internal and external relationships, we will strive for genuine, honest, and transparent communication.

        Resilience: we will continue to create a professional and sustainable (human, social, economic and environmental) organisation.
